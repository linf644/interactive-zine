        "The dog ate my homework" (or "My dog ate my homework") is an English
        expression which carries the suggestion of being a common, poorly
        fabricated excuse made by schoolchildren to explain their failure to
        turn in an assignment on time. The phrase is referenced, even beyond the
        educational context, as a sarcastic rejoinder to any similarly glib or
        otherwise insufficient or implausible explanation for a failure in any
        context. The claim of a dog eating one's homework is inherently suspect
        since it is both impossible for a teacher to disprove and conveniently
        absolves the student who gives that excuse of any blame. However,
        although suspicious, the claim is not absolutely beyond possibility
        since dogs are known to eat—or chew on—bunches of paper; John Steinbeck
        was once forced to ask his editor for additional time due to half the
        manuscript of Of Mice and Men having been eaten by his Irish setter. As
        an explanation for missing documents, it dates to a story about a Welsh
        minister first recorded in print in 1905. The Oxford English Dictionary
        suggests that a 1929 reference establishes that schoolchildren had at
        some time earlier than that offered it as an excuse to teachers. It was
        so recorded, more than once, in the 1965 bestselling novel Up the Down
        Staircase, and began to assume its present sense as the sine qua non of
        dubious excuses, particularly in American culture, both in school and
        out, in the 1970s. American presidents from Ronald Reagan to Barack
        Obama have used it to criticize political opponents, and it has been a
        source of humor for various comic strips and television shows, such as
        The Simpsons.
